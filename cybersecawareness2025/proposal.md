As we prepare for [Cyber Security Awareness Month](https://www.cisa.gov/cybersecurity-awareness-month) 2025 (October, 2025), the Death and the Digital Estate CG proposes delivering a white paper and planning resources for managing a digital estate.  These resources are planned for release in October 2025 where they can be cross promoted at venues such as the [Internet Identity Workshop](https://internetidentityworkshop.com/) and [Authenticate 2025](https://authenticatecon.com/).

The planned whitepaper will review the current state of digital estate management.  Using the real life examples from DADE CG members, the planned white paper will document the known current state of digital estate/legacy management, identify broad areas for improvement (e.g. legacy account management availability), and 

In addition to the whitepaper, we plan to deliver guidance to help individuals think through planning their digital estate.  Focusing on common scenarios - accounts with major platforms (e.g. Google, Apple, Microsoft), social media services (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn), and credential managers (e.g. 1Password, Dashlane), actionable guidance will be provided to enable individuals to determine how their digital assets will be managed.
