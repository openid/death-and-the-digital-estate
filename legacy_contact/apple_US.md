**The Process:**
* https://support.apple.com/en-us/102631

* On a Mac logged into my iCloud account, I opened the System Settings -> Apple Account -> Legacy Contact setting.  I chose a contact and wsa offered to send the legacy contact recovery code to my chosen contact via SMS/iMessage or to print a physical document.  I chose to print the physical document which will be stored with other related recovery documents in my safe deposit box.

**Qualitative assessment of what went well, what went wrong, what would have helped, etc.:**
* This was easier than expected, it took less than 5 minutes while on a flight. 
* More than one contact can be added, which is nice.  However, it is unclear as the owner of the iCloud account and payer on the account, how or if this works
when my credit card is cancelled and stops paying the monthly fees.  This needs to be explored further.

**Additional Data**
* https://digital-legacy.apple.com/ is used by the legacy contact to gain access to the account.
* https://support.apple.com/en-us/102431 has additional information for survivors.
