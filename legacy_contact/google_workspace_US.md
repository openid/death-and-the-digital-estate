**Adding a Legacy Contact**

**Service:** 

* Google Workspace
* https://workspace.google.com/

**Account Country / Countries**

* USA
* Configured as Google Workspace Business Starter account

**Account Type:**

* Personal

**The Process:**

* No help documentation found on assigning a legacy contact.

* In order to minimize the risk of loss of the account, I took the following steps in the console:
  * Added a second super admin user to the account
  * Added second user to receive billing statements as a Payment Contact under Billing -> Payment Accounts -> More -> Payments Settings
  * Paid annually to reduce the risk of the service expiring as soon as the first payment fails
 
* Additional ideas to reduce risk:
  * Add a second payment option bound to the additional payment contact to allow payments to continue after the primary contact is deceased and the credit card is frozen.
  * Develop documentation for the second super admin to take control of the account if the primary contact is deceased.  

**Qualitative assessment of what went well, what went wrong, what would have helped, etc.:**

* There is no defined process for handling this at Google Workspace.  

**Additional Data**

* None
