**Adding a Legacy Contact**

**Service:** 
GitHub

**Account Country / Countries**

USA

**Account Type:**

Personal, free tier account

**The Process:**

[Successors](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/maintaining-ownership-continuity-of-your-personal-accounts-repositories)

I was unable to execute the process.  There is another page describing the [GitHub Deceased User Policy](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-deceased-user-policy). 

**Qualitative assessment of what went well, what went wrong, what would have helped, etc.:**

Since my designated successor does not have a GitHub account, I was unable to add her as my successor.  However, in the [GitHub Deceased User Policy](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-deceased-user-policy) there are manual mechanisms to obtain access as a next of kin or designated successor.
