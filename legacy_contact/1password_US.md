**Adding a Legacy Contact**

**Service:** 

* 1Password
* https://1password.com

**Account Country / Countries**

* United States


**Account Type:**

* 1Password for Families

**The Process:**

* 1Password does not offer a mechanism to enable a legacy contact.  However, there are two options that exist to support this use case:
  * [Emergency Kit](https://support.1password.com/emergency-kit/) can be saved offline and used to recover access to the account.  This works for all 1Password accounts.  However, the contact must know of the emergency kit and how to use it.
  * Add additional family organizers who can manage the account.
    * If the account is purchased directly from 1Password, the family organizers can be added to the [Manage Billing group](https://support.1password.com/manage-subscription/).
      *  If the account payment lapses, a family organizer can [restore a frozen account](https://support.1password.com/frozen-account/).
    * If the account is purchased through an app store, family organizers cannot manage billing
      *  If the account payment lapses through the app store, it must be restored through the app store.
      *  There does not appear to be a mechanism to move between payment models, this may cause some users to be stuck.
      *  Risk can be mitigated by paying annually instead of monthly.

**Qualitative assessment of what went well, what went wrong, what would have helped, etc.:**

* Additional recovery options are needed for app store based accounts.
